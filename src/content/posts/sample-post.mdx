# Sample MDX Blog Post: Testing the New System

This is a **sample MDX blog post** to demonstrate how the new system works. MDX allows you to use React components directly in your markdown content!

## What You Can Do

### 1. **Regular Markdown**
- **Bold text** and *italic text*
- [Links to external sites](https://example.com)
- Lists like this one
- And numbered lists:
  1. First item
  2. Second item
  3. Third item

### 2. **Images**
You can include images using standard markdown syntax:

![Sample Image](/blog/sample-post-image.jpg)

### 3. **Blockquotes**
> This is a blockquote that can contain important information or quotes from other sources.

### 4. **Code Blocks**
```javascript
// You can include code blocks
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, MDX!");
}
```

## Frontmatter Support

This post demonstrates all the frontmatter fields that are supported:

- **Title**: Displayed as the main heading
- **Excerpt**: Used in blog listings
- **Author**: Shows who wrote the post
- **Date**: Publication date
- **Read Time**: Estimated reading time
- **Category**: For filtering posts
- **Featured**: Whether to show as featured
- **Tags**: For categorization
- **Image**: Hero image for the post

## How to Add New Posts

1. Create a new `.mdx` file in `src/content/posts/`
2. Add frontmatter at the top (between `---` markers)
3. Write your content using markdown syntax
4. Include images by placing them in `public/blog/` and referencing them
5. The post will automatically appear on your blog!

## Next Steps

Once this system is working, you'll be able to:
- Create posts in MDX format
- Include React components in your posts
- Use images and other media
- Have full control over styling and layout
