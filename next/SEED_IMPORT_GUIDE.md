## ðŸŽ¯ Testing Your Pages

   - Drop should show as "Upcoming" (starts 2025-09-25)

3. **Drop Detail Page**:
   - Countdown timer to drop start
   - List of 3 products with caps (150, 600, 300)

## ðŸ”§ Customization

### Adjust Drop Timing
Edit the drop in Studio to test different states:
- **Upcoming**: `startAt` in future
- **Live**: `startAt` in past, `endAt` in future  
- **Ended**: `endAt` in past

### Add Images
- Upload `mainImage` for products in Studio
- Images will automatically work with your `next.config.mjs` Sanity CDN setup

### Modify Pricing/SKUs
- Edit products in Studio
- Changes reflect immediately on marketplace pages

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Import Fails

- Verify CORS settings in Sanity project
- Restart development server

## ðŸŽ¨ Next Steps
