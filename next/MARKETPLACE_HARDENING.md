# Marketplace Hardening Implementation

This document outlines the changes made to harden the Sanity client and marketplace page to prevent 500 errors.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. `src/lib/sanity.client.ts` (NEW)
- **Purpose**: Centralized Sanity client configuration with proper environment variable handling
- **Features**:
  - Uses `SANITY_PROJECT_ID` or falls back to `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID`
  - Uses `SANITY_DATASET` or falls back to `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET`
  - Uses `SANITY_API_VERSION` with fallback to `2024-08-01`
  - Includes `SANITY_READ_TOKEN` if available
  - Sets `useCdn: false` for fresh server-side data
  - Returns `null` if project ID is missing (prevents crashes)

### 2. `src/lib/getProducts.ts` (NEW)
- **Purpose**: Safe product fetching with comprehensive error handling
- **Features**:
  - Safe GROQ query with `coalesce()` for null handling
  - Try/catch error handling that returns empty arrays on failure
  - TypeScript interfaces for type safety
  - Separate functions for all products and featured products
  - Graceful degradation when Sanity is unavailable

### 3. `app/marketplace/page.tsx` (MODIFIED)
- **Changes**:
  - Added `export const revalidate = 60` for ISR
  - Imports and uses `getProducts()` and `getFeaturedProducts()`
  - Passes real product data to components
  - Fetches data safely with `Promise.all()`

### 4. `app/marketplace/components/ProductGrid.tsx` (MODIFIED)
- **Changes**:
  - Updated to accept `products` prop from Sanity
  - Removed mock data
  - Enhanced filtering logic for categories, brands, and search
  - Added polished empty state with chillNOW-style CTA
  - Different empty states for "no products at all" vs "no filtered results"

### 5. `app/marketplace/components/FeaturedStrip.tsx` (MODIFIED)
- **Changes**:
  - Updated to accept `products` prop
  - Removed mock data
  - Added graceful handling of missing images
  - Returns `null` if no featured products (hides section)
  - Dynamic gradient backgrounds for products without images

### 6. `app/marketplace/components/ProductCard.tsx` (MODIFIED)
- **Changes**:
  - Updated to work with new `Product` interface from Sanity
  - Simplified to show product details without complex variant logic
  - Added fallback handling for missing brand/category data
  - Changed to "View Details" button instead of "Add to Cart"

## Key Features

### üõ°Ô∏è Error Prevention
- **Never crashes**: All Sanity calls wrapped in try/catch
- **Graceful degradation**: Returns empty arrays when Sanity is unavailable
- **Null safety**: Uses `coalesce()` in GROQ queries to handle missing data
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript interfaces for all data structures

### üé® Polished Empty States
- **Welcome message**: Friendly empty state when no products exist
- **Studio CTA**: Direct link to add first product
- **Newsletter signup**: Encourages waitlist signup
- **Filter feedback**: Clear messaging when filters return no results

### ‚ö° Performance
- **ISR**: 60-second revalidation for fresh data
- **Parallel fetching**: Products and featured products fetched simultaneously
- **Conditional rendering**: Featured strip only renders when products exist
- **Optimized queries**: Efficient GROQ with proper field selection

### üîß Environment Variables Required
```env
SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
SANITY_DATASET=production
SANITY_API_VERSION=2024-08-01
SANITY_READ_TOKEN=your_read_token
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
```

## Testing Scenarios

The implementation handles these scenarios gracefully:

1. ‚úÖ **No Sanity connection**: Shows empty state with CTA
2. ‚úÖ **Empty product database**: Shows welcome message
3. ‚úÖ **Sanity API errors**: Logs error, shows empty state
4. ‚úÖ **Missing product images**: Shows gradient backgrounds
5. ‚úÖ **Missing brand/category data**: Shows fallback text
6. ‚úÖ **Filter with no results**: Shows "no products found" message

## Next Steps

1. **Add product detail pages**: Create individual product pages
2. **Implement search**: Add full-text search functionality
3. **Add pagination**: Handle large product catalogs
4. **Cart integration**: Connect to e-commerce system
5. **Analytics**: Track product views and interactions
